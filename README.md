# SegmentTreeVisualizer
A java app to visualize build and query function of Segment Tree.

This is a JAVA APP named Segment Tree Visualizer ðŸŒ³ . This app shows the building visualization of Segment Tree thorugh cool animation for some added functions like Sum, Max, Min and Xor. I have also added query feature which accepts l and r integer values (indices between which query has to be processed (0 based index)) to show how query works on Segment Tree using animation and the highlighted nodes at last of query indicates these/this nodes/node are from which answer came (of which query is called ie, min,max,sum,xor).

To run the project you can also download the files and and open it in Visual Studio Code and shoud have all java dependency (mentioned at last) then navigate to App.java and click the Run option. Hope you enjoy it.
